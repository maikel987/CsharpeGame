You are a little Bacterie in Josline's Body.. 
Many cells from her immune defense will appeard in her body. You have to kill her!
	- when cells are smaller than you, they are green. You can eat them.
	- when cells are bigger (Red ones) they could eat you to Save Josline.

From Level 2 she will try harder to kill you. She will take pills.
	- Small pills (Yellow) could feed you, but they are hard to eat.
	- Big pills (Purple) would track you to death.

Becarefull, level after level her body will get faster, and the pills even more.

from the begining you have 3 lifes.
if you lost thoses lifes you won't return to level 1, but you will regress to the level bellow.
You lost life when you are aten, 
If you are the smaller you will play the same level without loosing life.
